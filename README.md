## Background
I created a script using jupyter notebook to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

## Observations
1. The highest temperature is near the 15 latitude line, and as the latitude decreases the temperture decreases.
2. Humidity increases as latitude increases and so does cloudiness.
3. Wind speed is not affected by latitude as there is a negative corelation in the southern hemisphere and a weak correlation in the northern hemisphere.
