## Background
I created a script using jupyter notebook to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

## Weather PY

## Observations
1. The highest temperature is near the 15 latitude line, and as the latitude decreases the temperture decreases.
2. Humidity increases as latitude increases and so does cloudiness.
3. Wind speed is not affected by latitude as there is a negative corelation in the southern hemisphere and a weak correlation in the northern hemisphere.

## Vacation PY
Using the weatherPY data I can plan future vacations based on my ideal weather. I can utilize the GMaps API to plot the best locations for my ideal weather.

My Ideal weather conditions are:
  1. Wind speet less than or equal to 10 MPH
  2. Cloudiness of 0
  3. Minimum Temperture of 70 with a max temperture of 85.

Using the script I was ablo to narrow down where I would like to go on vacation. In looking at the map I would narrow it down to 2 cities:
  1. Buenos Aires, Argentina.
  2. Doha, Qatar.
